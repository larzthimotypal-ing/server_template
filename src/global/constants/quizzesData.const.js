The LGU knew that this policy would be controversial among Pasig City residents lower speed limits might be seen as worsening traffic in an already congested city center. Pasig City officials chose the topic “Low-Speed Streets”for their Digital Democracy process to ask  Pasig city residents, students, and workers what they think about the policy. On the other hand, Intramuros Administration chose a narrow topic of Pedestrianization of Heneral Luna St. because they already had a clear scope for their policy, and wanted to avoid misconceptions that streets vital to motor vehicles would be closed off. This particular stage in the Digital Democracy process shows what step? ",
